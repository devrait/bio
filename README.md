## About

This is my personal website — a clean, modern, and interactive way to showcase my professional profile. I built it using current front-end best practices like **glassmorphism**, animated particle backgrounds, and ambient music to create an engaging experience for anyone visiting.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic, accessible markup  
- **CSS3** with responsive design and modern glassmorphism effects  
- **JavaScript** leveraging [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) for dynamic backgrounds  
- **Font Awesome 6** for crisp, recognizable icons  
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for clean and modern typography

## Features

- Fully responsive — works great on any device or screen size  
- Darkened, blurred background image that highlights main content  
- Smooth animated particle effects adding a subtle modern touch  
- Looping ambient audio for immersive atmosphere  
- Accessibility-first navigation with keyboard support and ARIA labels  
- Clean and easy-to-update social and contact links
